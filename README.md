# Secret Santa 🎁

**Secret Santa** is a web application for anonymous gift exchange during the Christmas holidays.  
It requires no registration or personal data from participants.

⚠️ **Note:** This application is designed for regular users without web development skills.  
There is **no encryption** when transmitting data to the server, so anyone familiar with browser developer tools can view the matchmaking results via the **Network** tab.
